This is a latex - style file following the corporate design of the WWU
Muenster. It redefines all quantities needed in a beamer-presentation.
Furthermore the maketitle command is redefined to build the titlepage
introduced in the corporate design manual in documentclasses like
article or book.

Usage:      Just put \usepackage{wwustyle} in the header of your tex
            file, that's all!
            You may reset the main color by using COLORCODE
            as an option to the package, where COLORCODE is the
            name of the color (in one word, all in small letters) 
            as defined in the corporate design manual which is 
            to be found on the web:
            http://www.wwu.de/corporate-design/
            For usage of the english claim "living.knowledge" instead of
            "wissen.leben" in the design, add the option "english" when
            loading the wwustyle style.
            Furthermore, if your documentclass is 'beamer' and you
            choose the option "wide", you will get presentations in
            16:10. 
Remark:     This uses the MetaNormal font, which is to be found as
            a latex font on the homepage of the WWU and should be available 
            for employees in the tex distribution on the WWU workstations.
